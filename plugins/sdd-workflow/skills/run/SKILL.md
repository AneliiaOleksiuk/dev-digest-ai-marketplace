description: "Produces a retrospective on a multi-agent session that already happened in THIS conversation -- token/time spent per agent, spawn order, round-trips, friction the agents themselves reported, and concrete recommendations for next time. MANUAL ONLY -- invoke exclusively when the user explicitly runs /run or asks for a retro/retrospective by name. Never invoke this proactively at the end of a workflow (run-plan or any other multi-agent chain), even when it looks like a natural place to run it. Applies to any multi-agent session in this conversation, not just run-plan's implementer->test-writer->plan-verifier->doc-writer chain. Writes chat output plus a ledger file under .sdd/retro/."

# Run (workflow retro)

Retrospective on a multi-agent session that already ran in this
conversation: how many agents, in what order, at what token/time cost, how
much back-and-forth each one took, what friction they actually reported,
and — not optional — what to do differently next time.

## Trigger — manual only

Run this skill **only** when the user explicitly invokes `/run` or asks
for a retro/retrospective by name. Never run it proactively at the end of
`run-plan` or any other multi-agent chain just because the chain finished
— this stays manual. If a future request asks to make it automatic, that
is a change to this file, not something to infer from context.

## Input

Optional arguments, in either order: `deep` to enable Deep mode (see
below); anything else is treated as a task slug for the ledger filename.
If no slug is given, derive a short kebab-slug from the topic of the
workflow being retro'd (the Spec/Plan name, or a short description of what
the agents were doing).

If it's ambiguous which part of the conversation the retro should cover
(e.g. the session had two unrelated multi-agent stretches), ask the user
which one before gathering anything.

## What to gather — in context (default)

Everything here comes from what is already visible in this conversation —
no extra reads, no extra agent calls:

- **Every agent spawn**: name, order, foreground vs background, model
  override if any, and what it was asked to do (one line).
- **Per-agent cost**: tokens, tool uses, and duration from each spawn
  result's usage data. Report these as observed numbers, never estimated
  or rounded into a false precision.
- **Round-trips**: how many times each agent was resumed after its first
  run. This is the cheapest available proxy for "was the initial brief
  complete" — an agent resumed twice means the first prompt was missing
  something the second one had to supply.
- **Self-reported friction**: anything an agent's own final report already
  said about its constraints or difficulty. Quote or closely paraphrase
  these — never invent a difficulty an agent didn't actually report.
- **Your own orchestration overhead**: how many times you (the main agent)
  had to re-read a file, re-grep, or re-derive something a subagent's
  report should have already covered — this is duplication you can
  actually observe, unlike a subagent's internal tool calls, which you
  cannot see.

**What you genuinely cannot see by default**: a subagent's internal tool
calls (what it read, how many times, in what order). Do not claim to know
whether two subagents duplicated file reads unless one of them said so in
its report, or unless you are in Deep mode (below). If the ledger needs to
say "possible duplication," label it as inferred/unconfirmed, not observed.

## Deep mode (`deep` argument)

Opt-in only — costs more, so only run it when asked. Two things Deep mode
adds, both bounded:

1. **Read the raw per-agent output file**, if the harness exposes one for
   a background agent's task notification. Skip silently (note the gap,
   don't fail) if it's unavailable.
2. **One targeted follow-up per agent, at most.** For an agent still
   resumable by name, you may send **one** follow-up message asking a
   specific retro question its standard report contract doesn't cover
   (e.g. "what would have saved you a tool call if it had been in the
   original prompt?"). Never spawn a **new** agent instance just to gather
   retro data — that inflates the exact cost this skill exists to measure.
   Cap at one follow-up per agent; if the answer doesn't fit in one
   message, move on rather than iterating.

Label every fact gathered this way as `[deep]` in the report, so a reader
comparing two retros (one default, one deep) knows which numbers are
comparable.

## Report shape (identical content in chat and in the ledger file)

```
# Workflow Retro: <slug>
Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Mode: default | deep
Scope: <one line -- what workflow/session this covers>

## Timeline
| # | Agent | Mode | Model | Tokens | Tool uses | Duration | Round-trips |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
...

## Totals
Agents spawned: N · Total subagent tokens: N · Total round-trips: N ·
Wall-clock: ~Nm

## Insights
- <one atomic, self-contained bullet per insight -- one claim, grounded in
  something actually observed, no narrative paragraph>
- ...

## Recommendations
- <concrete, actionable proposal for next time -- a prompt to inline
  upfront, a step to merge or drop, a question to front-load instead of
  round-tripping. Not optional -- always populate this section, even if
  the only finding is "this run was clean, nothing to change.">
- ...
```

Every `Insights` bullet must be traceable to something actually gathered
above (a usage number, a quoted self-report, an observed round-trip) —
no invented claims. Distinguish "observed" from "[deep]" from "inferred,
unconfirmed" inline where it matters.

## Ledger

Write the same content to `.sdd/retro/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md` — one file
per retro run, the same one-file-per-instance convention this plugin
already uses for specs and plans, rather than one ever-growing log file.
Create `.sdd/retro/` if it doesn't exist yet.

When a retro's `Recommendations` reference a pattern seen before (e.g.
"this is the second time an agent got resumed for a question that could
have been asked upfront"), glob `.sdd/retro/*.md` for prior retros on a
related topic and cite them — but only when you actually find one, never
claim a trend from a single data point.

## Rules

- Manual trigger only — see Trigger above; do not soften this over time
  without an explicit request to do so.
- Never fabricate a metric. Missing data is reported as missing, not
  interpolated.
- Deep mode's one-follow-up-per-agent cap is a hard limit, not a
  suggestion — re-spawning agents to investigate the workflow defeats the
  purpose of measuring it cheaply.
- `Recommendations` is mandatory in every report, not just when something
  went wrong.
- Write scope is `.sdd/retro/` only — never edit the agents, specs, or
  plans this retro is reporting on.
